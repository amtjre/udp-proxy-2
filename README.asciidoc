UDP Starcraft Proxy
===================

Synopsis
--------

A proxy for replaying UDP packets, designed to allow StarCraft to be
played in LAN mode over the internet. There is also a packet inspection
tool specifically designed for UDP. Probably later will come a game
browser.


Usage
-----

Ideally: ./forward.sh IP

This should be run on a box that is not used for StarCraft, and is on the
same LAN as the other machines that are playing. For example, create a
virtual LAN, and then use those machines to forward UDP packets out to
everyone playing the game. As soon as a game is created on this network,
all listening clients should pick it up. For this reason, UDP injection
of broadcast packets flowing the other direction is an eventual goal.
